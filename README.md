## Nitori

#### This project is in very early development

Nitori is a CLI tool for controlling and monitoring the system's CPU, battery and screen backlight on Linux-based operating systems.

### Supported features
* **CPU**: Montior hardware specifications and current configuration, set clock speeds, set kernel governor
* **Battery**: Set battery charge limit and monitor specifications, manufacturer, power usage and charge capabilities
* **Backlight**: Set and view the screen backlight brightness for built-in laptop screens

## Requirements
* Linux-based systems are the only systems that work
* Java 11 or newer

Nitori is only tested on x86_64 CPUs, but it might also work on other CPU architectures. Battery support is only tested with lithium-ion batteries.
